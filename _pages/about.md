Filippo is an engineer with a Master's degree in computer science from Italy. :computer:

He likes tecnology in every way, but he also loves nature and to be a scout chief. :leaves: He likes digital photography to combine these two worlds. :camera:

He's very open-minded, he likes to argue about speeches of any kind (eg. medicine, mechanic, physics, mathematics, robotics, energy, philosophy, religion, ..). :pill: :microscope: :telescope: :rocket:

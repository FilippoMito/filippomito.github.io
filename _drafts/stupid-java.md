# STUPID Java

STUPID is a set of principles to avoid while writing code, because they almost always have adverse impact on testability, quality, extensibility, maintainability, and reusability.

**S** - Singleton
**T** - Tight Coupling
**U** - Untestability
**P** - Premature Optimization
**I** - Indescriptive Naming
**D** - Duplication
